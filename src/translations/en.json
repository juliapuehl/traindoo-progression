The programming view shows you everything you could possibly need - the athlete’s 1RM values, historical performance values, and even progress graphs. The surrounding functions all cater towards one goal: making programming as efficient as possible. Use templates for days, weeks, and even full cycles. Leveraging Traindoo’s full potential let’s you become a programming rockstar!",
  "OVERLAY_ONBOARDING_DESCRIPTION_3": "In the exercise library you can set up your own exercises and add images and videos (also as Youtube links). Traindoo lets you create daily and weekly check questionnaires that you want your athletes to fill out in their mobile apps. These checks are also customizable. Use multiple templates for different kinds of athletes, such as one for beginners and another one for pros with certain cycle targets.",
  "OVERLAY_ONBOARDING_DESCRIPTION_4": "Traindoo allows you to make the most of the data you collect from your athletes. Explore the development of daily and weekly checks in the health section (heart icon). Daily and weekly checks data can be soon either as table or graph. If you want to customize your personal dashboard, go to the the statistics section (bar plot icon). Select metrics and timeframes that are most relevant to you and arrange everything according to your goals.",
